# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project is designed to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets using big data technologies. The aim of the project is to extract meaningful insights from the tweets and analyze the sentiments expressed by users on **artificial intelligence**.

The project will involve collecting data from Twitter using the Twitter API and storing it in a distributed data storage system (Hadoop HDFS). The tweets will then be preprocessed and cleaned to remove noise and irrelevant information.

The sentiment analysis will be performed using machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier. The accuracy of the sentiment analysis model will be evaluated using precision, recall, accuracy, ROC_AUC, and F1 score.

Finally, the project will involve visualizing the sentiment analysis results using Amazon QuickSight. The visualizations will help to provide insights into the sentiments expressed by users and their overall opinions on the topic or event.

Overall, this project will showcase the capabilities of big data technologies and machine learning algorithms in performing sentiment analysis on large datasets of tweets.
